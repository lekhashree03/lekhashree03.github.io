        <p>
          My roots trace back to a small town in India, where I was among the
          few granted access to quality education from primary through
          undergraduate levels. From dreaming of being a bus driver to serving
          as a student leader, my desire to influence and contribute to society
          has been unwavering. Venturing into uncharted territories with a
          positive outlook has defined my path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within one year of starting my Data Science journey, I transitioned
          from an analyst to a Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer, building
          small-scale data products. A pivotal moment was earning a spot in
          IIT Madrasâ€™s pioneering online BS in Data Science & Programming,
          which led to roles at Incedo and Tredence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond work, I volunteered as a bus driver to help those without
          transport access, especially to hospitals. Iâ€™ve also begun scripting
          intraday trading strategies, blending my domain knowledge in wealth
          management with automated order execution across broker platforms.
